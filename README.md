## Limitations of this software

- The actual files of the digital references are not included. It was surprisingly difficult to store PDF files on a database and display them on the app. We intend to resolve it soon enough.
- The form window is not resizable. Certain UI components would ruin the user experience if the window was resizable. We intend to resolve it soon enough.
- Adding and removing references from the database through the UI is not yet functional.

## What you need to install first

1. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (2019 or greater).
2. [Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (19 or greater).

## Steps for running it

1. Clone this repository with Visual Studio.

3. Navigate to the repositoryâ€™s directory on your machine and run this command on your preferred CLI:
    
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```
    
4. Go to `Tools` >> `NuGet Package Manager` >> `Manage NuGet Packages for Solution` and check to see if the following packages are installed on your solution.

    1. `Guna.UI2.WinForms`
    2. `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`
    3. `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
    4. `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`
    5. `PdfiumViewer`
6. Go to `Tools` >> `NuGet Package Manager` >> `Package Manager Console` and run the following commands to initialize the database with Entity Framework Core.

    _This creates a migration file for initializing the database structure and all the relationships between the entities._
    ```bash
    Add-Migration InitialCreate
    ```

    _This actually creates the database on your localhost._
    ```bash
    Update-Database
    ```
    
7. Open the project with Visual Studio and `Debug` >> `Start Debugging` (F5).

### How to test sorting functionality

1. Navigate to the top of the app where you find the search button and click the drop down menu with the sorting icon next to it.

2. Choose either `Published Date`, `Author`, `Title` to tell the App on which property of the references it should sort the references with.
3. Navigate to each category to view the sorted references with the criteria that you have set.
4. The pages, which include `My Feed` and `Top References` will now be sorted with the sorting criteria that you have selected.

### How to test searching functionality

1. Navigate to the top of the app click the search button on the top right corner.
2. After Clicking on the search button you will have the option to search using binary or linear search.

3. Click on the toggle switch to choose searching algorithm you want.

4. The only difference between the two types of searching is that `binary searching` only works on already `sorted data`. Also the `search key` must be exactly what is found on the references properties to be found as a result of the search.
5. To search by title you have to first sort by Title.
6. To search by Author you have to first sort by Author.

    1. Note if you do search by Author make sure to either search the first name only or the last name only.
    2. This is because a reference only has a first name or last name property and not a full name property.

7. Lastly to search by published data you have to first sort by Published date.
