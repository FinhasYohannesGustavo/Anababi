2. Choose either `Published Date`, `Author`, `Title` to tell the App on which property of the references it should sort the references with.
3. Navigate to each category to view the sorted references with the criteria that you have set.
4. The pages, which include `My Feed` and `Top References` will now be sorted with the sorting criteria that you have selected.

### How to test searching functionality

1. Navigate to the top of the app click the search button on the top right corner.
2. After Clicking on the search button you will have the option to search using binary or linear search.

4. The only difference between the two types of searching is that `binary searching` only works on already `sorted data`.
5. To search by title you have to first sort by Title.
6. To search by Author you have to first sort by Author.

    1. Note if you do search by Author make sure to either search the first name only or the last name only.
    2. This is because a reference only has a first name or last name property and not a full name property.

7. Lastly to search by published data you have to first sort by Published date.
