## Limitations of this software

- The actual files of the digital references are not included. It was surprisingly difficult to store PDF files on a database and display them on the app. We intend to resolve it soon enough.
- The form window is not resizable. Certain UI components would ruin the user experience if the window was resizable. We intend to resolve it soon enough.
